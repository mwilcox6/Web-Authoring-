  Growing up, I would always make breakfast for my younger siblings.They were all so picky and they never wanted anything I prepared. That changed the day I made my famous homestyle potatoes and sausage.
  <br>
  I usually eat this meal as a quick breakdfast option. I am currently a pescatarian so I don't eat the sausage but I still prepare it for my siblings. Today, I will walk you through my infamous recipie.
